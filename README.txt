This is A project where Different Animals race. In this case, we have Hare, Elephant, Dog, Duck.I constructed main parts of the code using inheritance.
Each animal had their own algorithm, that determined their speed which was based on probability.Which was done using array of integers.
Example:int speed {1,2,0, 0, -4, 9}. A randomizer was used to get a number between 0 and the size of the array. Which determined if the animal went forward, backward or stayed 
at the same place. speed[4] = -4 steps. speed[5] = + 9 steps. 

teh Road class made the rode which
Competetion class made the different animals compete.
